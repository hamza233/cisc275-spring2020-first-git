1. Create java files to make this code compile and run.

2. What five objects are created in the main?
	An array list, 3 dogs and a comparator
3. Can you spot the Comparator constructor call? Where is the class definition for the Comparator?
	Comparator constructor call is on line 16 in MyCompare3.java
	new Comparator<Animal>()
	It isn't a class, Comparator is an interface, it is imported from the library java.util.Comparator
